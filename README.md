## Requirements
Using React Boilerplate, create an application. (Expected to take 6-10 hours). Upon completion, respond to this email with a link to your GitHub fork of the React Boilerplate repo.

* One page shall have UI to input a string which saves to a database of your choice.
* One page shall display all strings stored on the database.
* User shall be able to navigate between the two pages.
* The application need not be fully styled but should be laid out in a meaningful way. No need to deploy the application.

## Libraries
The application must leverage:
* React Router
* Redux
* Redux Saga
* Reselect
* Styled Components - Use at least one styled component. The component must have a prop passed in for conditional rendering.
* Unit Tests - Write tests for one container. Full test coverage is not required.
